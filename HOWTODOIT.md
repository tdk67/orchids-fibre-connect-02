# Lead Management Requirements

## 1. Unified Storage
All leads, whether generated by the "Lead Generator" or imported via Excel, MUST be stored in the same database table (`leads`).

## 2. Persistence
Leads found by the generator must be saved to the database IMMEDIATELY. They should not rely on local state or be lost when the application restarts or the page is refreshed.

## 3. Data Compatibility
Generated leads must have a data structure compatible with imported leads. This includes fields like:
- Company Name (Firma)
- Address (Strasse, Hausnummer, PLZ, Stadt)
- Contact Info (Email, Telefon, Web)
- Coordinates (lat, lng) for map display

## 4. Area Assignment
Leads must be assigned to the specific **Area** (Bereich) they were generated for. This is determined either by the area selection in the generator or by matching the street name to an existing area's defined streets.

## 5. Deduplication
Prevent duplicate leads in the database. A lead is considered a duplicate if:
- **Normalization**: Names and addresses are normalized by removing accents (e.g., "é" -> "e"), removing content in parentheses, and stripping legal forms (GmbH, KG, etc.).
- **Same Name & Fuzzy Address**: Same normalized company name and same street/base house number (e.g., "Potsdamer Str. 81a" and "Potsdamer Str. 81 A" match).
- **Same Address & Fuzzy Name**: Same address and street number, where one business name is a subset of the other (e.g., "Positions Berlin GmbH" vs "Positions Berlin").
- **Identical Email**: If an email exists and is identical, it's the same business.

Deduplication MUST happen automatically during generation and import. The user should not have to manually trigger a cleanup.

## 6. Map Integration
ALL leads in the database that have valid coordinates must be displayed on the map, regardless of their source (Import or Generator).
