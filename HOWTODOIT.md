# Lead Management Requirements

## 1. Unified Storage
All leads, whether generated by the "Lead Generator" or imported via Excel, MUST be stored in the same database table (`leads`).

## 2. Persistence
Leads found by the generator must be saved to the database IMMEDIATELY. They should not rely on local state or be lost when the application restarts or the page is refreshed.

## 3. Data Compatibility
Generated leads must have a data structure compatible with imported leads. This includes fields like:
- Company Name (Firma)
- Address (Strasse, Hausnummer, PLZ, Stadt)
- Contact Info (Email, Telefon, Web)
- Coordinates (lat, lng) for map display

## 4. Area Assignment
Leads must be assigned to the specific **Area** (Bereich) they were generated for. This is determined either by the area selection in the generator or by matching the street name to an existing area's defined streets.

## 5. Deduplication
Prevent duplicate leads in the database. A lead is considered a duplicate if:
- **Normalization**: Names and addresses are normalized by removing accents (e.g., "é" -> "e"), removing content in parentheses, and stripping legal forms (GmbH, KG, etc.).
- **Same Name & Fuzzy Address**: Same normalized company name and same street/base house number (e.g., "Potsdamer Str. 81a" and "Potsdamer Str. 81 A" match).
- **Same Address & Fuzzy Name**: Same address and street number, where one business name is a subset of the other (e.g., "Positions Berlin GmbH" vs "Positions Berlin").
- **Identical Email**: If an email exists and is identical, it's the same business.

Deduplication MUST happen automatically during generation and import. The user should not have to manually trigger a cleanup.

## 6. Map Integration & Geocoding
- **Local Geocoding Cache**: To avoid Nominatim rate limits (1 query/sec), the system uses a local `geocoding_cache` table. 
- **Mass Data Import**: You can pre-populate this cache for entire cities using the OpenStreetMap (OSM) data.
  - **Overpass API**: Use `node scripts/import-osm.js "Berlin"` to download all addresses for a city and store them locally.
  - **OSM Data Extraction**: The system extracts `addr:street`, `addr:housenumber`, `addr:postcode`, `addr:city`, and the corresponding `latitude/longitude` from OSM nodes and ways.
- **Coordinate Assignment**: Coordinates are assigned by checking the local cache first. If missing, it falls back to Nominatim and then saves the result to the cache for future use.
- **Consistency**: The system ensures "Same Address = Same Coordinates" by using exact matches in the cache.
- **Display**: ALL leads in the database with valid latitude/longitude are displayed on the map.

## 7. Lead Recovery (Duplicate Handling)
- **Problem**: Previously, if the generator found a business already in the database (e.g., from an Excel import), it would skip it, making it seem "lost" to the user.
- **Solution**: The system now checks if an existing lead matches the generated one. If found, it automatically assigns that existing lead to the current **Area** (Bereich) by updating its `area_id`. This ensures previously imported leads appear in the context of the current search area.
