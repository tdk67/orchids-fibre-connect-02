# Lead Management Requirements

## 1. Unified Storage
All leads, whether generated by the "Lead Generator" or imported via Excel, MUST be stored in the same database table (`leads`).

## 2. Persistence
Leads found by the generator must be saved to the database IMMEDIATELY. They should not rely on local state or be lost when the application restarts or the page is refreshed.

## 3. Data Compatibility
Generated leads must have a data structure compatible with imported leads. This includes fields like:
- Company Name (Firma)
- Address (Strasse, Hausnummer, PLZ, Stadt)
- Contact Info (Email, Telefon, Web)
- Coordinates (lat, lng) for map display

## 4. Area Assignment
Leads must be assigned to the specific **Area** (Bereich) they were generated for. This is determined either by the area selection in the generator or by matching the street name to an existing area's defined streets.

## 5. Deduplication
Prevent duplicate leads in the database. A lead is considered a duplicate if:
- **Normalization**: Names and addresses are normalized by removing accents (e.g., "é" -> "e"), removing content in parentheses, and stripping legal forms (GmbH, KG, etc.).
- **Same Name & Fuzzy Address**: Same normalized company name and same street/base house number (e.g., "Potsdamer Str. 81a" and "Potsdamer Str. 81 A" match).
- **Same Address & Fuzzy Name**: Same address and street number, where one business name is a subset of the other (e.g., "Positions Berlin GmbH" vs "Positions Berlin").
- **Identical Email**: If an email exists and is identical, it's the same business.

Deduplication MUST happen automatically during generation and import. The user should not have to manually trigger a cleanup.

## 6. Map Integration & Geocoding
- **Local Geocoding Cache**: To avoid Nominatim rate limits (1 query/sec), the system uses a local `geocoding_cache` table. 
- **Mass Data Import (UI)**: In the **Unternehmenssuche** (Map view), you can use the **"OSM Daten"** button.
  - **Status Check**: The UI shows if a city's data has already been imported.
  - **Import/Update**: You can trigger a mass import from OpenStreetMap directly in the browser. It uses the Overpass API to fetch building addresses and coordinates.
  - **No Duplicates**: The import uses an "Upsert" mechanism to update existing entries and add new ones without creating duplicates.
  - **Actualization**: You can see the date of the last import and re-run it at any time to get the latest OSM data.
- **Coordinate Assignment**: Coordinates are assigned by checking the local cache first. If missing, it falls back to Nominatim and then saves the result to the cache for future use.
- **Consistency**: The system ensures "Same Address = Same Coordinates" by using exact matches in the cache.
- **Display**: ALL leads in the database with valid latitude/longitude are displayed on the map.

## 7. Lead Recovery (Duplicate Handling)
- **Problem**: Previously, if the generator found a business already in the database (e.g., from an Excel import), it would skip it, making it seem "lost" to the user.
- **Solution**: If an existing lead matches a generated one, the system automatically assigns that lead to the current **Area** (Bereich). This ensures previously imported leads appear in the search context.
- **Auto-Correction**: If a lead is missing coordinates but a match is found in the geocoding cache, it is updated automatically.
